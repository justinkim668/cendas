# cendas - About
cendas is a new pandas-based framework optimized for analyzing data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau and other U.S. government agencies.  The word "cendas" is a portmanteau of the words "census" and "pandas."  I was motivated to develop this python package from my experiences doing research at the Internet Real-Time Lab at Columbia University with Prof. Henning Schulzrinne.  Throughout the course of my research, I worked a lot with broadband adoption data provided by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and demographics data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.  I oftentimes found myself using the same blocks of code over and over again on these datasets.  As a result, I thought it would be a good idea to put some of this code I used into a python package for the purposes of increasing workflow efficiency.  I also figured I probably wasn't the only one who would find this useful.  If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me at jtk2141@columbia.edu.
